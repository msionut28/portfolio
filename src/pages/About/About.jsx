            How it all started?

          <p className="montserrat passion custom-text-style">
            <br />
            I have always found myself intrigued by coding and how computers
            work, but mainly fascinated about Web, how things rendered and were
            displayed to us.
            <br /> <br />
            My very first contact with coding was quite a few years ago, when I
            decided to dive in head first in this subject, mainly relying on
            web-packs and internet tutorials to build the things that I wanted.
            Back then, I used to build blogs and forums using <b>WordPress</b>,
            as well as <b>phpBB</b> and Invision Community(<b>IPS</b>).
            <br /> <br />
            Fast-forward a few years, in April 2023 I decided to start
            self-teaching myself web-development, as the passion for coding and
            web development never faded away. I decided to follow courses on
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginLeft: "0.3vw" }}>
              Codecademy
            </span>
            , slowly moving towards <b>Udemy</b> courses.
